# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
    To create a flow from defined conditions into true or false statements and execute actions based on the evaluation.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
    I would learn more ways to achieve the same goal. The more I looked something up the more I found a clearer way of doing it.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
  I helped someone figure out some of the assignment today and that really was helpful for me to solidify my own knowledge that I hade learned today.
